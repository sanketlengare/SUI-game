# My Personal Project

## SUI-GAME




For the personal project I have decided to make a GUI 
represented soccer game called ***SUI-GAME***. The game is very simple as 
there will not be a player to player control but instead the computer will simulate 
the game without any user inputs once the teams are formed.
Simply, the user will be acting as a manager of a team and would be able to view statistics 
such as score, time, and other relevant statistics. 

In the game, a team can be formed using a set of players with 
different ratings. Once two teams with a set of 11 players 
are formed, the computer will implement the game according to
the difference in team ratings, where the team ratings are 
based on singular player ratings. 

In soccer games, the role of a manager often faces oversight. The sole 
**purpose** of such a game is to acknowledge the role of a manager where there is 
need to manage the teams, choosing players, choosing tactics, etc. 

**User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to play with pre-existing teams.
